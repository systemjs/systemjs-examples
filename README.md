## Contributing

Please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Do not require an npm install or build step for running locally or for github pages deployment. This means you should push all built files to github and update the built files every time you change the source files.
2. Please put examples into either the system.js or s.js directories. Each example should be a directory with a descriptive name. The example directory must contain an index.html file.
3. Please do not lock your example to a specific version of system.js or s.js. You can link to the latest version of system.js and its extras with `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/systemjs/dist/system.js`.
